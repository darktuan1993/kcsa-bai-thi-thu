## **📌 Roadmap 2025**
Our goal is to **continuously improve the KCSA Mock Exam App** by keeping the questions **up-to-date, categorized, and well-explained**.  

### **🛠️ 1. Keep Questions Updated**  
- **Ensure alignment with the latest KCSA exam domains** and real-world Kubernetes security concerns.  
- Regularly review and **update questions** to match **CNCF security best practices**.  
- Implement a **versioning system** for tracking **historical changes** to questions.  

---

### **📌 2. Classify Questions by Domain**  
- Improve **question categorization** for easier **targeted learning**.  
- Enable users to **focus on specific security areas** (e.g., **container runtime security, network policies, IAM roles**).  
- Implement **better search and filtering capabilities** for practice exams.  

---

### **📖 3. Improve Explanations with Source References**  
- Add **verified source links** to each question:  
  ```json
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "Kubernetes Documentation",
      "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/"
    }
  ]
  ```
- Ensure **every correct answer has an explanation** linked to **official Kubernetes documentation or security standards**.  
- Allow users to **submit suggested sources** via **Pull Requests**.  

---

### **🎯 4. Advanced Analytics for Learning Insights**  
- Implement **performance tracking & analytics**:  
  - **Weakest domains** (e.g., **Pod Security Policies, RBAC, etc.**).  
  - **Exam attempt history & improvement trends**.  
- Add **leaderboard-style insights** (e.g., top **scored categories** vs. **most missed**).  

---

### **🔄 5. Implement a Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**  
- Introduce **adaptive learning**, prioritizing questions users struggle with.  
- Allow users to **mark difficult questions** for future review.  
- Optimize question order based on **learning retention models**.  

---

### **🌍 6. Strengthen Community Collaboration**  
- Open a **public issue tracker** for reporting **question errors, missing sources, and improvements**.  
- Introduce a **collaborative review process** for new questions.  
- Host periodic **community discussions** on **Kubernetes security topics**.
