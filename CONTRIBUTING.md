# **üõ† How to Contribute**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Contributing to Question Updates**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open an Issue**  
Before making changes, **open an issue** in the repository to describe:  
- The **question ID** you are updating.  
- The **problem with the question** (e.g., incorrect answer, missing explanation, outdated reference).  
- The **proposed fix** or improvement.  

üí° **Example Issue:**  
```
Title: Update Question id: 42 ‚Äì Incorrect Explanation  

Description:  
The explanation for question id: 42 is incorrect.  
- **Current Explanation:** "Kubernetes API Server is responsible for managing nodes directly."  
- **Corrected Explanation:** "The Kubernetes API Server serves as the control plane, exposing RESTful APIs for interacting with the cluster."  
- **Adding Sources:** ["Kubernetes Documentation", "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/"]
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch**  
Once your issue is approved or if you're directly contributing a fix:  
```bash
git checkout -b update-question-<question_id>
```
Replace `<question_id>` with the **actual question ID**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the Exported JavaScript Files**  
1. Locate the question file in **`src/exported-questions/`**  
   - Example: `src/exported-questions/Cloud_Native_Security.js`
2. Modify the question, **ensuring proper JSON formatting**.
3. **Add sources** in the correct format:  
```js
export const CloudNativeSecurityQuestions = [
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is the main function of a Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)?",
    "options": [
      "Monitor network traffic",
      "Secure workloads across environments",
      "Manage cloud costs"
    ],
    "correct_answers": [1],
    "explanation": "CWPPs protect workloads across multiple environments.",
    "question_type": "single-choice",
    "domain": "Cloud Native Security",
    "subdomain": "Workload and Application Code Security",
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "Kubernetes Documentation",
        "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/"
      }
    ]
  }
];
```
‚úÖ **Ensure:**
- üìù **Correct formatting** (`sources` must be an **array of objects** with `name` & `url`).  
- üî¢ **Accuracy** (Check `correct_answers`, `explanation`, and `options`).
